### Minikernel

Totally ineffective and useless but very fun to develop and learn something new. My playground for low-level programming.

If you wish to develop something similar, I can recommend:
* [Professional Assembly Language](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/810011.Professional_Assembly_Language)
* [Operating System Development Series](http://www.brokenthorn.com/Resources/OSDevIndex.html) + [OSDev Wiki](https://wiki.osdev.org/)
